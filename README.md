# My thesis on whether private school tuition is more expensive than public school tuition is intriguing. This issue is significant for families assessing their children's educational options. I examine an essential dataset that helpsÂ families make these crucial decisions by researching the cost disparities between private and public schools. Furthermore, my study may give insights into the variables contributing to tuition cost discrepancies and the consequences for educational fairness. My project can illuminate an essential topic while informing policymakers and educators about the best strategies for providing a high-quality education to all kids.
